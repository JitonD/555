<div>The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) is the 19th 
museum of the Smithsonian Institution. Initiated through an Act of Congress in 2003, the museum opened on September 24, 2016. It currently houses over 40,000 cultural artifacts, which it exhibits, nearly outgrowing its five-acre space on the National Mall in Washington, DC. </div>



<p style="text-decoration: left; color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Purpose of the Collection</p>
<p>

Lonnie G. Bunch, III, Founding Director of NMAAHC declared that “This Museum will tell the American story through the lens of African American history and culture.” Likely for funding reasons and to open the space up to all people, it was important to reiterate that “This is America’s Story and this museum is for all Americans.” Further, the third pillar upon which the NMAAHC stands makes clear that the museum is not just for Black people, but for all people. It states that the museum “explores what it means to be an American and share how American values like resiliency, optimism, and spirituality are reflected in African American history and culture.”
</p>
<p>
This evaluation focuses on the electronic system that consists of images of each item in the museum collection, for download and reproduction purposes.
</p>

<p>
<p style="text-decoration: left; color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Users of the Electronic Collection</p>


Target users of the digital collection will include scholars, teachers and professors of American and African American history who live outside of the Washington, DC area; young students who prefer to do their research online; anyone inside and outside of the area who needs a reproduction of an original print, or the image of an artifact held in the collection. As an electronic collection, it contains photographs, portraits, digital media - born analog, drawings, digital media - born digital. 
</p>
<p style="text-decoration: left; color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Design</p>

<p>

The landing page design for the collection is a visual representation of their mission, welcoming their target user.  A large image greets the user. It depicts a beautiful blue sky above a row of 12 American flags. Some of them waved in the wind, guiding the eye to the middle left of the image where the distinctive architecture of the National Museum of African American History and Culture sits darkened in the background. Across the bottom third of the image are blurry figures enjoying their day on the National Mall. Drawing the whole scene together is a curved road that leads from a classical Smithsonian Institute building far left, past the front of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, toward the Nation’s Capital to the far right. 
</p>
<p>
Further subordinating the image of the museum building is the large bold white text: “The Collection.” The text completely covers the building, which is already hidden in the shadows. Everything about this image is reflective of the mission of the collection to present the American story through an African American lens. The color scheme is blue, white and red, which is punctuated by the row of American flags that present proudly across the center of the page. The image conveys that this museum is for and about the American people because African-American history and culture is American history and culture.
</p>
<p style="text-decoration: left; color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Navigation</p>

<p>

The design is simple and navigation is user friendly, inviting deeper exploration of the site. Across the top of the page is a thin black banner with striking white silhouettes of the museum and Smithsonian logo to the left. On the right side of the banner is text that list navigation options. Rather than drop-down menus, information pops up as a thicker banner across the middle of the page. Linked options lead to more refined information. Once a word on the banner is activated, it remains red. The only other red on the black background is the “Donate” button with white text. Then there is a magnifying glass.  
</p>
<p>
From “explore” the thick banner across listed options. I was searching for the digital collection, so I clicked on “Digital Resource Guide.” However, it took me to a page that digitally explores certain exhibits and services that they offer online. Going back, the first option on the “explore” menu, “Search the Collection,” took me to “The Collection” landing page as described above. Labeling could be clearer. The page was consistent with the design of the museum homepage as the same navigation banner appears across the top of the page.  
</p>
<p>
If the user knows what they want, they can enter their search term on the “Search” line on the large image below the large bold text “The Collection.” It goes to a page listing multiple entries. The left column offers a refining filter that begins with the current search. The middle column is the image of the artifact that they have in the museum and the right column is the description of the artifact with a link for “object details.” 
</p>
<p>
Back to the landing page. If the patron does not know specifically what they are looking for, right below the welcoming image is this statement, 




<style>
div {
  background-color: blue;
  width: 1300px;
  border: 50px solid yellow;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>

<div>The Smithsonian has launched its Open Access Initiative. Images of objects from the NMAAHC collection are now available to view, download, and share through a CC0 license. 
</div>







Below that is a banner that allows the user to browse the collection by topic, date/era, name, object type, or place. Next is a grid of large thumbnail images representing search categories. Go to “Name” on the browse banner, click on the image labeled “Martin Luther King, Jr.” for example, and 246 entries come up. That search can be further refined with options in the left column. 
</p>
<p style="text-decoration: left; color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</p>

<p>

My assessment is that the system is easy to navigate and is clear in its messaging through design, but there were a few things that stood out to me that could be improved. I take no issue with design—it is inviting, encouraging, safe. Nor could I ask for an easier search process. However, the system only does what the administration tells it to do, and the administration is clearly biased.
</p>
<p>
Messaging for the museum borders on bias in the way they reach out to, signal and invite non-African American users from all over the country to search the collection. They seem to diminish the focus on African Americans for perhaps those of certain political persuasion who electronically visit the collection.
</p>
<p>
After the glaring messaging of the landing page image, another example presents itself on the same page. “Topic” is the first browse option, yet there is no logical reason for the order in which search options are listed. The thumbnail images representing the link to specific topics are also oddly ordered in a neat grid. The first three topics across are: 


ol.c {
  list-style-type: number;
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<ol class="c">
  <li>Degign</li>
  <li>Latinx</li>
  <li>LGBTQ+</li>
</ol>

  






 
 
 
There are some people of color in the Latinx image, but the subject is not African Americans. The next three topics are:
ol.c {
  list-style-type: number;
}

</style>
</head>
<body>

<ol class="c">
  <li>The American West</li>
  <li>Black Lives Matter</li>
  <li>Civil Rights</li>
</ol>

Here is where topics become alphabetized. Finally, the fifth option focuses on African Americans. This order reinforces the organization’s attempts to distance itself from a presentation or even the celebration of African American history and culture in favor of a broader American story.  
</p>
<p>
I would argue that the bias is most blatant when clicking on the image of Barack Obama that returns zero results.
